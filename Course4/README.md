### Course 4: Convolutional Neural Networks

In the fourth course of the Deep Learning Specialization, students understand how computer vision has evolved and become familiar with its exciting applications such as autonomous driving, face recognition, reading radiology images, and more.

By the end, students are able to build a convolutional neural network, including recent variations such as residual networks; apply convolutional networks to visual detection and recognition tasks; and use neural style transfer to generate art and apply these algorithms to a variety of image, video, and other 2D or 3D data.

*Skills: Decision-Making, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Inductive Transfer, Multi-Task Learning*
