### Course 2: Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization

In the second course of the Deep Learning Specialization, students open the deep learning black box to understand the processes that drive performance and generate good results systematically.

By the end, students learn the best practices to train and develop test sets and analyze bias/variance for building deep learning applications; are able to use standard neural network techniques such as initialization, L2 and dropout regularization, hyperparameter tuning, batch normalization, and gradient checking; implement and apply a variety of optimization algorithms, such as mini-batch gradient descent, Momentum, RMSprop and Adam, and check for their convergence; and implement a neural network in TensorFlow.

*Skills: Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Recurrent Neural Network, Natural Language Processing, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Attention Models*
