### Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning
In the first course of the Deep Learning Specialization, students study the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning.

By the end, students are familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to their own applications.

The Deep Learning Specialization is their foundational program that helps them understand the capabilities, challenges, and consequences of deep learning and prepares them to participate in the development of leading-edge AI technology. It provides a pathway for them to gain the knowledge and skills to apply machine learning to their work, level up their technical career, and take the definitive step in the world of AI.
