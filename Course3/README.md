### Course 3: Structuring Machine Learning Projects

In the third course of the Deep Learning Specialization, students learn how to build a successful machine learning project and get to practice decision-making as a machine learning project leader.

By the end, students are able to diagnose errors in a machine learning system; prioritize strategies for reducing errors; understand complex ML settings, such as mismatched training/test sets, and comparing to and/or surpassing human-level performance; and apply end-to-end learning, transfer learning, and multi-task learning.

*Skills: Artificial Neural Network, Backpropagation, Python Programming, Deep Learning, Neural Network Architecture*

- This third course doesn't have programming assignments.
